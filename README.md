# Airbnb Analysis

This project seeks to understand the Boston and Seattle markets.  The data available is for 2016 and 2017 in different date ranges.

# Business Questions

Some of the questions we could be answering based on the data are as follows:

    Have the rent distributions or averages changed over the year?
    Are there certain dates where occupation spikes?
    How do rent trends compare across both states?
    How do different property and room types compare to each other?
    Are there certain factors that could affect the rent prices in each location?

Ultimately the post wants to provide information regarding the best places to rent and have a certain type of experience.

# Code

All code is stored in `AirBnB Analysis.ipynb` and uses the following libraries:

- Pandas and Numpy to manage the data
- matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations
- from sklearn, LinearRegression as well as the evaluation metrics r2_score, train_test_split and StandardScaler
